# Flexible-Tree
Tool to create Chart of Accounts (CoA)  - like structures. A list of numbers with a fixed number of digits is converted into a tree. The nodes are established by dividing the digits into variable groupings
This can be seen as a stand-alone or add on to database oriented applications such as accounting packages (like Memory or SAP) or learning management systems (like Moodle)
I intend to build it in Haskell and Python, and see how they compare in aspects like efficiency and compatibility.
